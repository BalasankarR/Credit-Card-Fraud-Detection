# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project is on the subject of Credit Card Fraud Detection, the dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.

We will do some exploratory data analysis, then we will dive into designing ML Models for the problem.

As this problem is a classification problem, we will realise that this dataset is a highly imbalanced dataset (because the number of fraudulent transactions are expected to be a small fraction of the total transactions), we will therefore also look at ways of dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Accuracy is not a good measure of the model's performance (Since the model that predicts all datapoints to be in the Majority Class will also have a good accuracy but is not a good model per se), and so we will also understand about the other metrics that are available and evaluate our model's performances accordingly.
